# Revised Academic Paper Proposals: Demonstrative Approach

## Strategic Positioning: **"Application Demonstration"** Not **"Method Comparison"**

### Key Principles:

- **Present what we did**, not why it's better
- **Show applicability**, not superiority
- **Demonstrate results**, not comparative performance
- **Explain our approach**, not critique existing methods
- **Focus on "what we found"**, not "what others missed"

## **Key Language Changes Throughout Both Papers**:

### **Instead of saying**:

- "Superior performance compared to..."
- "Overcomes limitations of existing methods..."
- "Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches..."
- "Addresses shortcomings in current techniques..."

### **We say**:

- "Our analysis revealed..."
- "We observed patterns of..."
- "Our implementation demonstrates..."
- "This approach provides..."
- "We found that our method..."
- "Our results suggest..."

### **Tone and Positioning**:

- **Humble**: "We explored the application of..."
- **Descriptive**: "Our analysis showed..."
- **Demonstrative**: "We present results from..."
- **Exploratory**: "This work investigates..."
- **Practical**: "We implemented and tested..."

This approach is much safer, more honest, and positions your work as a valuable **contribution** rather than a **competition**. It shows scientific integrity and makes the papers much more likely to be well-received by reviewers who are experts in their fields.

The focus becomes: _"Here's an interesting computational approach, here's how we applied it to biology, and here's what we found"_ rather than _"Here's why our approach is better than what everyone else is doing."_

This is excellent strategic thinking! 🎯
