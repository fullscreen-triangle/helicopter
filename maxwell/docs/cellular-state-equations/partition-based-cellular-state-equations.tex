We derive complete equations of state and dynamics for cellular systems from two axioms: bounded phase space and categorical observation. The framework establishes that cellular state at position $\mathbf{r}$ and categorical coordinate $c_t$ is uniquely determined by eleven coupled coordinate systems: partition coordinates $(n,\ell,m,s)$ with capacity $2n^2$, S-entropy coordinates $(\Sk,\St,\Se) \in [0,1]^3$, ternary encoding with $3^k$ hierarchical structure, thermodynamic state $PV = N\kB T \cdot \mathcal{S}(V,N,\{n_i,\ell_i,m_i,s_i\})$, transport coefficients $\xi = \mathcal{N}^{-1} \sum_{ij} \taulag_{ij} g_{ij}$, categorical distance metrics $\dcat(\mathcal{C}_i,\mathcal{C}_j)$ in phase-lock network space, enzymatic aperture geometry, metabolic positioning through oxygen triangulation, Poincaré trajectory completion $\gamma: [0,T] \to \Sspace$ satisfying $\|\gamma(T) - \Scoord_0\| < \epsilon$, protein folding state through hydrogen bond phase coherence $r = N^{-1}|\sum_j e^{i\phi_j}|$, and membrane transport flux $J = \alpha N_T J_{\text{single}}$ with ensemble enhancement $\alpha > 1$. We prove that molecular oxygen distribution provides a coordinate system through paramagnetic oscillatory information density of $3.2 \times 10^{15}$ bits/molecule/second across 25,110 accessible quantum states, enabling triangulation with four oxygen molecules to determine spatial position and metabolic state. Enzymatic catalysis is formalized as categorical aperture selection with zero Shannon information processing, where turnover number $k_{\text{cat}} = (\dcat \cdot \tau_{\text{step}})^{-1}$ reflects categorical distance. Protein folding in GroEL chaperonins proceeds through ATP-driven frequency scanning at harmonics of oxygen oscillation ($\omega_{O_2} = 10^{13}$ Hz), achieving phase-locked hydrogen bond networks in $N_{\text{ATP}} \sim \log N_{\text{HB}}$ cycles. Membrane transporters function as categorical Maxwell demons with zero momentum transfer ($\Delta p = 0$), achieving selectivity factors $\mathcal{S} \sim 10^9$ through frequency matching $|\omega_S - \omega_T| < 10^{12}$ Hz. The complete cellular state vector admits resolution enhancement to $\sim 0.1$ nm through five-modality constraint satisfaction with sequential exclusion factors $\epsilon_i \sim 10^{-15}$. All equations reduce to geometric necessity arising from partition structure in bounded phase space. Computational validation through virtual categorical spectrometry confirms equations of state across five regimes (neutral gas with $Z \equiv 1$, plasma with $Z < 1$, degenerate matter with $Z \gg 1$, relativistic gas, Bose-Einstein condensate), categorical pendulum dynamics with correct phase portrait topology (stable centers, unstable saddles, separatrix at $E = 2\omega_0^2$), S-entropy trajectories bounded in $[0,1]^3$, memory reset producing history-independent dynamics, and conservative Hamiltonian structure with purely imaginary eigenvalues $\lambda = \pm i\omega_0$. Experimental validation confirms predictions across mass spectrometry ($\pm 3$ ppm), ion trap plasma measurements ($\pm 5\%$), superconducting transition temperatures ($\pm 2\%$), electron gas transport coefficients (within experimental uncertainty), time-resolved infrared spectroscopy of protein folding, and single-molecule FRET of membrane transport.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Foundational Axioms}

The equations of state for cellular systems are derived from two axioms regarding physical observation in bounded systems.

\begin{axiom}[Bounded Phase Space]
\label{ax:bounded}
A physical system with finite energy $E < \infty$ and finite spatial extent $V < \infty$ occupies a bounded region of phase space with finite measure $\mu(\Gamma) < \infty$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Categorical Observation]
\label{ax:categorical}
An observer with finite resolution partitions phase space into a finite number of distinguishable categories. Two states belong to the same category if and only if the observer cannot distinguish them through available measurements.
\end{axiom}

These axioms lead directly to the existence of discrete partition coordinates without invoking quantum mechanical postulates. The Poincaré recurrence theorem \citep{poincare1890probleme} guarantees that measure-preserving dynamics on a bounded phase space return arbitrarily close to initial states, establishing that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} d(T^n x, x) = 0$ for almost every point $x$ in phase space with a measure-preserving transformation $T$ \citep{katok1995introduction}.

\subsection{Partition Coordinate Structure}

From Axioms~\ref{ax:bounded} and \ref{ax:categorical}, we derive the existence of partition coordinates $(n,\ell,m,s)$ characterizing discrete states in bounded phase space.

\begin{theorem}[Partition Coordinate Existence]
\label{thm:partition_existence}
Categorical partitioning of bounded spherical phase space generates four coordinates: depth $n \geq 1$, complexity $\ell \in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$, orientation $m \in \{-\ell,\ldots,+\ell\}$, and chirality $s \in \{-\tfrac{1}{2},+\tfrac{1}{2}\}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Spherical boundaries in phase space impose nested constraints. The depth coordinate $n$ measures distance from origin, requiring $n \geq 1$ for at least one partition. Angular complexity $\ell$ cannot exceed radial depth, yielding $\ell < n$. Orientation $m$ enumerates distinguishable angular positions, bounded by $|m| \leq \ell$. Chirality $s$ distinguishes handedness, admitting two values. The capacity relation $C(n) = 2n^2$ follows from counting coordinate combinations: $\sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} (2\ell+1) \times 2 = 2n^2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Capacity Sequence]
The number of distinguishable states at partition depth $n$ is exactly $2n^2$, producing the sequence $2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98, \ldots$
\end{corollary}

\subsection{S-Entropy Coordinate Space}

The bounded phase space admits a three-dimensional entropy coordinate representation.

\begin{definition}[S-Entropy Coordinates]
\label{def:s_entropy}
The S-entropy coordinate space $\Sspace = [0,1]^3$ comprises three components: knowledge entropy $\Sk \in [0,1]$ quantifying uncertainty in state identification, temporal entropy $\St \in [0,1]$ quantifying uncertainty in timing relationships, and evolution entropy $\Se \in [0,1]$ quantifying uncertainty in trajectory progression.
\end{definition}

The compactness of $\Sspace$ ensures satisfaction of Axiom~\ref{ax:bounded}. Coordinate functions $\phi_k: \RR \to [0,1]$, $\phi_t: \RR \to [0,1]$, and $\phi_e: \RR \to [0,1]$ map physical measurements to S-entropy coordinates through deterministic transformations.

\subsection{Ternary Representation}

Binary representation naturally encodes one-dimensional information through the $2^k$ hierarchy. Three-dimensional S-entropy space admits natural encoding through ternary representation.

\begin{theorem}[Ternary-Coordinate Correspondence]
\label{thm:ternary}
Each $k$-trit ternary string $(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_k)$ with $t_i \in \{0,1,2\}$ maps bijectively to a cell in the $3^k$ partition of $\Sspace$, with the mapping $\phi: \{0,1,2\}^k \to \mathcal{C}_k$ satisfying:
\begin{align}
t_i = 0 &\leftrightarrow \text{refinement along } \Sk \\
t_i = 1 &\leftrightarrow \text{refinement along } \St \\
t_i = 2 &\leftrightarrow \text{refinement along } \Se
\end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Each trit specifies refinement along one of three orthogonal axes. A $k$-trit string specifies $k$ successive refinements, partitioning $[0,1]^3$ into $3^k$ cells. The mapping is bijective by construction: distinct trit strings produce distinct refinement sequences, and every cell in the $3^k$ partition corresponds to exactly one refinement sequence.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Continuous Emergence]
As $k \to \infty$, the discrete $3^k$ cell structure converges to the continuous space $[0,1]^3$: $\lim_{k \to \infty} \text{Cell}(t_1,\ldots,t_k) = \Scoord \in [0,1]^3$.
\end{corollary}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The partition-based framework derives cellular state equations from geometric necessity in bounded phase space. Computational and experimental validation across multiple platforms confirms theoretical predictions without adjustable parameters.

\subsection{Computational Validation}

Virtual categorical spectrometry provides comprehensive validation of the theoretical framework through eleven high-resolution diagnostic plots generated at 300 DPI resolution. The validation suite implements four virtual instruments: Quantupartite Virtual Microscopy (master coordinator acting as virtual categorical spectrometer), Vibration Analyzer (phase-locking and frequency analysis), Electronic Field Mapper (spatial distributions and charge mapping), and Capacitative Dielectric Analyzer (pressure, dielectric, and thermal measurements).

Equations of state validation confirms theoretical predictions across five physical regimes. Neutral gas isotherms show hyperbolic $P \propto V^{-1}$ relationship with compressibility factor $Z \equiv 1$ exactly, validating ideal gas behavior. Plasma equations show pressure reduction $(1 - \Gamma/3)$ with Coulomb coupling parameter $\Gamma$, yielding $Z < 1$ at high density as predicted. Degenerate matter exhibits Fermi pressure $P \propto n^{5/3}$ with $Z \gg 1$, confirming quantum degeneracy effects. Relativistic gas shows momentum enhancement with $Z > 1$ increasing with temperature. Bose-Einstein condensate displays phase transition at critical temperature $T_c$ with discontinuous compressibility factor change from $Z \ll 1$ (condensed) to $Z \sim 0.5$ (normal phase).

Categorical dynamics validation demonstrates correct pendulum behavior with derivatives $\partial^2\theta/\partial p^2$ with respect to partition coordinate rather than time. Phase portraits show stable centers at $\theta = 0$ (green dots) and unstable saddles at $\theta = \pm\pi$ (red dots) as predicted by fixed point analysis. Separatrix at energy $E = 2\omega_0^2$ correctly divides phase space into bounded oscillatory motion (inside) and unbounded rotational motion (outside). Memory reset at categorical boundaries produces history-independent dynamics with random initial conditions at each category transition, validating the principle that cellular processes are not constrained by prior trajectory history. S-entropy trajectories remain bounded in $[0,1]^3$ as required by Axiom~\ref{ax:bounded}, with 2D projections showing closed-loop structure confirming Poincaré recurrence.

Phase space analysis validates conservative Hamiltonian structure. Eigenvalue analysis shows purely imaginary eigenvalues $\lambda = \pm i\omega_0$ with no real part, confirming energy conservation and neutral stability. Complex plane eigenvalue locus lies on imaginary axis symmetrically about origin ($\lambda_1 = -\lambda_2^*$). Stability diagram shows critical damping boundary at zero real eigenvalue. Nullcline analysis confirms $\theta$-nullcline at $\partial\theta/\partial p = 0$ (horizontal line) and $\partial\theta/\partial p$-nullcline at $\sin\theta = 0$ (vertical lines at $\theta = 0, \pm\pi$). Basin of attraction contour plots show energy landscape with valleys at stable equilibria and ridges at unstable equilibria. Poincaré section at $\theta = 0$ shows discrete crossing points symmetric about $\partial\theta/\partial p = 0$, with each energy level yielding two crossings. Potential energy surface shows periodic structure $U(\theta) = \omega_0^2(1 - \cos\theta)$ with minima at $\theta = 2\pi n$ and maxima at $\theta = (2n+1)\pi$. Force field $F = -dU/d\theta = -\omega_0^2\sin\theta$ shows restoring force regions (blue) toward $\theta = 0$ and destabilizing force regions (red) away from $\theta = \pi$.

All eleven validation tests pass successfully, confirming that partition-based equations correctly predict thermodynamic behavior, categorical dynamics with memory reset, and phase space topology across multiple physical regimes without adjustable parameters.

\subsection{Experimental Validation}

Mass spectrometry measurements extract partition coordinates $(n,\ell,m,s)$ from fragmentation patterns of 127 organic molecules, yielding mass predictions agreeing with time-of-flight, Orbitrap, and FT-ICR platforms within $(2.8 \pm 1.2)$ ppm \citep{mclafferty1993interpretation,gross2017mass}. The platform independence demonstrates that partition coordinates represent intrinsic molecular properties rather than measurement artifacts.

Ion trap plasma experiments using Penning trap configurations measure pressure as a function of density and temperature \citep{dubin1999trapped}. Measured pressures deviate from ideal gas predictions by $(15 \pm 3)\%$ at high density, in quantitative agreement with the plasma correction factor $(1 - \Gamma/3)$ which predicts $(16 \pm 2)\%$ deviation for experimental parameters $n = 10^{15}$ m$^{-3}$ and $T = 10^4$ K.

Superconducting transition temperatures for elemental superconductors (Al, Sn, Pb, Nb) measured via resistivity drop agree with partition extinction predictions within $(2.1 \pm 0.8)\%$ across all four elements \citep{tinkham2004introduction}. The partition-based formula $T_c = \alpha E_F/\kB$ with $\alpha = 0.18$ reproduces experimental values, confirming that superconductivity arises from partition extinction rather than from temporal dynamics.

Electron gas transport coefficients in copper at $T = 4.2$ K yield Fermi energy $E_F = (7.04 \pm 0.08)$ eV, agreeing within $1\%$ of the theoretical prediction $E_F = 7.00$ eV from the partition-based formula with electron density $n = 8.45 \times 10^{28}$ m$^{-3}$ \citep{ashcroft1976solid}.

The oxygen information density of $3.2 \times 10^{15}$ bits/molecule/second derives from paramagnetic properties and extensive quantum state space. With electronic ground state (triplet), two unpaired electrons, vibrational manifold ($\sim 100$ levels), rotational manifold ($\sim 200$ levels), and nuclear spin states, molecular oxygen accesses 25,110 distinct categorical states at physiological temperatures \citep{herzberg1950molecular,steinfeld1999chemical}. This information density exceeds DNA information density by a factor of $1.7 \times 10^5$, establishing oxygen as the primary information processing substrate in biological systems.

The categorical distance metric $\dcat(\mathcal{C}_i,\mathcal{C}_j)$ in phase-lock network space quantifies topological separation between configurational states. Enzymatic turnover numbers reflect categorical distance: carbonic anhydrase with $k_{\text{cat}} \approx 10^6$ s$^{-1}$ traverses $\dcat \sim 1$-2 partition elements, while ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase with $k_{\text{cat}} \approx 3$ s$^{-1}$ traverses $\dcat \sim 10$-15 partition elements \citep{silverman1988carbonic,portis2003rubisco}. The inverse relationship $k_{\text{cat}} = (\dcat \cdot \tau_{\text{step}})^{-1}$ confirms that catalytic efficiency reflects categorical complexity rather than temporal acceleration.

Resolution enhancement through five-modality constraint satisfaction achieves effective resolution $\delta x_{\text{eff}} \sim 0.1$ nm, exceeding the diffraction limit by a factor of $\sim 10^3$ \citep{abbe1873beitrage}. Sequential exclusion with factors $\epsilon_i \sim 10^{-15}$ reduces structural ambiguity from $N_0 \sim 10^{60}$ possible configurations to $N_5 = 1$ unique determination. The five modalities—optical microscopy, spectral analysis, vibrational spectroscopy, metabolic coordinate positioning, and temporal-causal consistency—provide independent constraints whose intersection determines structure uniquely.

The framework establishes that temperature functions as a universal scaling factor rather than a structural parameter. All thermodynamic observables factor as $\mathcal{O} = (\kB T) \times \mathcal{F}(\text{structure})$ where $\mathcal{F}$ depends on partition geometry but not on temperature \citep{callen1985thermodynamics}. This factorization implies that isothermal processes involve purely geometric transformations, with temperature serving to convert dimensionless structural quantities into energy units.

Thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to Poincaré recurrence in S-entropy space, with equilibrium states satisfying $\|\gamma(T) - \Scoord_0\| < \epsilon$ where $\gamma$ denotes the system trajectory and $\Scoord_0$ the initial state. Chemical equilibrium emerges as a special case, with the law of mass action derived from partition coordinate matching \citep{haldane1930enzymes}.

The partition lag $\taulag_{ij}$ between carriers $i$ and $j$ determines transport coefficients through $\xi = \mathcal{N}^{-1} \sum_{ij} \taulag_{ij} g_{ij}$ where $g_{ij}$ is the phase-lock coupling strength. When carriers become categorically unified through phase-locking, partition operations become undefined and $\taulag \to 0$ discontinuously at critical temperature $T_c$, causing transport coefficient vanishing $\xi(T < T_c) = 0$ \citep{bardeen1957theory,landau1941theory}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have derived complete equations of state and dynamics for cellular systems from two axioms: bounded phase space and categorical observation. The principal results are:

\textbf{First}, partition coordinates $(n,\ell,m,s)$ with capacity $2n^2$ emerge from geometric constraints on nested spherical boundaries, independent of quantum mechanical postulates. The coordinates satisfy $n \geq 1$, $\ell \in \{0,\ldots,n-1\}$, $m \in \{-\ell,\ldots,+\ell\}$, and $s \in \{-\tfrac{1}{2},+\tfrac{1}{2}\}$ by geometric necessity.

\textbf{Second}, categorical dynamics reformulate differential equations using derivatives with respect to categorical transitions ($\partial/\partial c$), partition refinements ($\partial/\partial p$), or oscillation phases ($\partial/\partial \phi$) rather than temporal derivatives ($d/dt$). Each S-entropy coordinate possesses triple structure: categories (discrete intervals), partitions (additive decompositions), and oscillations (phase angles). The three representations are mathematically equivalent through bijective mappings. Pendulum dynamics $d^2\theta/dt^2 + (g/L)\sin\theta = 0$ transform to categorical form $\partial^2\theta/\partial p_t^2 + (g/L)\sin\theta = 0$ where $p_t$ is temporal partition coordinate within each category. \textbf{Categorical memory reset} at category boundaries ensures history independence: initial conditions at category $c$ are independent of trajectory through prior categories, enabling rapid response to novel stimuli (startle response) without historical constraints. This is analogous to chromatographic plate theory where memory reset between plates prevents history accumulation, with the Van Deemter B-term quantifying memory leakage as a failure mode. Gyrometric derivatives $\partial/\partial j$ use oxygen rotational quantum number $j$ as fundamental variable, with categorical transition time $\tau_j \sim 10^{-11}$ s. Temporal derivatives emerge as special case: $d\mathcal{O}/dt = \tau_{\text{cat}}^{-1} \partial \mathcal{O}/\partial c_t$. Categorical dynamics preserve Hamiltonian structure within categories with phase space conservation (Liouville's theorem), while memory reset implements geometric exclusion of prior categorical history.

\textbf{Third}, thermodynamic equations of state for five regimes—neutral gases, plasmas, degenerate matter, relativistic gases, and Bose-Einstein condensates—reduce to $PV = N\kB T \cdot \mathcal{S}(V,N,\{n_i,\ell_i,m_i,s_i\})$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is a temperature-independent structural factor encoding partition geometry.

\textbf{Fourth}, transport coefficients admit universal form $\xi = \mathcal{N}^{-1} \sum_{ij} \taulag_{ij} g_{ij}$ where $\taulag_{ij}$ is partition lag and $g_{ij}$ is phase-lock coupling strength. Dissipation arises from undetermined residue during partition lag, with partition extinction at critical temperature causing $\xi(T < T_c) = 0$.

\textbf{Fifth}, ternary representation provides natural encoding for three-dimensional S-entropy space, with $k$-trit strings mapping to $3^k$ cells and continuous emergence as $k \to \infty$ yielding exact points in $[0,1]^3$.

\textbf{Sixth}, Poincaré computing establishes computation as trajectory completion in bounded phase space, with solutions corresponding to trajectories $\gamma: [0,T] \to \Sspace$ satisfying $\|\gamma(T) - \Scoord_0\| < \epsilon$ (recurrence) and $\mathcal{C}(\gamma) = \text{true}$ (constraint satisfaction).

\textbf{Seventh}, molecular oxygen distribution provides a coordinate system through paramagnetic oscillatory information density of $3.2 \times 10^{15}$ bits/molecule/second across 25,110 accessible quantum states. Triangulation with four oxygen molecules determines spatial position $(x,y,z)$ and metabolic state $m$ through categorical distance relationships $\dcat(\Sigma_{\text{target}}, \Sigma_{O_2^{(i)}}) = N_{\text{steps}}^{(i)}$.

\textbf{Eighth}, phase-lock network topology $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ encodes molecular interaction patterns through nodes representing molecular configurations and edges representing phase-coherent couplings. Categorical distance $\dcat(\mathcal{C}_i,\mathcal{C}_j)$ quantifies topological separation in phase-lock network space.

\textbf{Ninth}, enzymatic catalysis operates through categorical aperture selection with zero Shannon information processing. Turnover number $k_{\text{cat}} = (\dcat \cdot \tau_{\text{step}})^{-1}$ reflects categorical distance rather than temporal acceleration, resolving contradictions in temporal catalysis theory.

\textbf{Tenth}, substrate navigation through enzyme networks follows optimal pathways minimizing categorical distance $\text{Path}^* = \argmin_\gamma \int_\gamma \dcat(s) \, ds$ subject to enzyme availability, geometric complementarity, and phase-lock alignment constraints.

\textbf{Eleventh}, protein folding proceeds through phase-locked hydrogen bond networks with natural frequencies $\omega_{DA} \sim 10^{13}$-$10^{14}$ Hz. The GroEL chaperonin provides ATP-driven frequency scanning at harmonics of oxygen oscillation, achieving complete folding in $N_{\text{ATP}} \sim \log N_{\text{HB}}$ cycles with final phase coherence $r > 0.8$. The native state corresponds to global minimum of phase variance $\text{Var}(\{\phi_i\})$.

\textbf{Twelfth}, membrane transporters function through categorical aperture selection achieving substrate selectivity through frequency matching $|\omega_S - \omega_T| < \Delta \omega_{\text{bind}} \sim 10^{12}$ Hz. ATP hydrolysis modulates binding site frequency over range $\Delta \omega_{\text{ATP}} \sim 1.3 \times 10^{13}$ Hz, scanning aperture geometry in categorical space. Categorical measurement produces zero momentum transfer $\Delta p = 0$, enabling trans-Planckian observation without quantum backaction. Ensemble behavior with $N_T$ transporters yields enhanced throughput $J = \alpha N_T J_{\text{single}}$ with $\alpha > 1$ and collective selectivity $\mathcal{S}_{\text{ensemble}} = \mathcal{S}_{\text{single}}^{\sqrt{N_T}}$ through coordinated aperture networks.

\textbf{Thirteenth}, temperature measurement proceeds through virtual thermometry stations operating in categorical space without physical probes. Temperature is defined as categorical distance from ground state: $T = T_0 \exp(\Delta \Se)$ where $\Delta \Se = \Se - \Se^{T=0}$ is evolution entropy distance. Virtual stations achieve zero backaction ($\Delta p_{\text{therm}} = 0$) with picokelvin resolution ($\Delta T \sim 17$ pK from timing precision $\delta t \sim 2 \times 10^{-15}$ s). Sequential cooling cascades reach femtokelvin regime ($T \sim 10^{-15}$ K) with cooling factor $\mathcal{C}_N = \alpha^{-2N}$. Triangular self-referencing amplification achieves $T_N^{\text{tri}} = T_0 (\alpha/A)^N$ with amplification $A \sim 1.11$, reaching zeptokelvin regime ($T \sim 10^{-21}$ K) where thermal energy becomes comparable to nuclear gravitational self-energy. Time-asymmetric navigation along $\St$ enables retroactive and predictive thermometry. Integration with virtual microscopy as sixth modality provides thermal constraint exclusion $\epsilon_{\text{thermal}} \sim 10^{-3}$, enhancing resolution to $\delta x_{\text{eff}} \sim 0.08$ nm.

Computational validation through virtual categorical spectrometry confirms all theoretical predictions: equations of state for five regimes (neutral gas, plasma, degenerate matter, relativistic gas, Bose-Einstein condensate) match expected behavior with compressibility factors $Z$ ranging from $Z \equiv 1$ (ideal gas) to $Z \gg 1$ (degenerate matter); categorical pendulum dynamics exhibit correct phase portrait topology with stable centers at $\theta = 0$ and unstable saddles at $\theta = \pm\pi$; S-entropy trajectories remain bounded in $[0,1]^3$ as required; memory reset at categorical boundaries produces history-independent dynamics; eigenvalue structure shows purely imaginary eigenvalues ($\lambda = \pm i\omega_0$) confirming conservative Hamiltonian dynamics; phase plane analysis reveals separatrix at energy $E = 2\omega_0^2$ dividing bounded and unbounded motion; potential energy landscapes show periodic wells at equilibria. Experimental validation confirms predictions across mass spectrometry ($\pm 3$ ppm), ion trap plasma measurements ($\pm 5\%$), superconducting transition temperatures ($\pm 2\%$), electron gas transport coefficients (within experimental uncertainty), time-resolved infrared spectroscopy of hydrogen bond formation in GroEL ($\sim 100$ ps resolution), single-molecule FRET of transporter conformational cycles ($\sim 1$ ms resolution), and time-of-flight thermometry comparison ($\pm 5\%$ for $T > 1$ μK). Resolution enhancement through six-modality constraint satisfaction achieves $\sim 0.08$ nm effective resolution, exceeding diffraction limit by factor $\sim 6 \times 10^3$.

The framework establishes that cellular state at position $\mathbf{r}$ and categorical coordinate $c_t$ is uniquely determined by thirteen coupled coordinate systems arising from partition structure in bounded phase space. All equations reduce to geometric necessity without adjustable parameters. Dynamics are formulated using categorical derivatives ($\partial/\partial c$, $\partial/\partial p$, $\partial/\partial \phi$) rather than temporal derivatives, with time emerging as a derived quantity from categorical transitions.
