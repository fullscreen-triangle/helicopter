\section{Foundational Framework}
\label{sec:foundational}

This section establishes the mathematical foundations for partition-based thermodynamics. We derive coordinate systems from geometric constraints, establish the triple equivalence between oscillations, categories, and partitions, and prove that temperature acts as a universal scaling factor rather than a structural parameter.
