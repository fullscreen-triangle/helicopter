# Partition-Based Imaging: Unified Framework

This document unifies three previously separate papers into a single coherent work:

1. **Imaging from First Principles** - Deriving images, videos, and microscopy from categorical partitions
2. **Information Catalysis & See-Through Imaging** - Virtual imaging as categorical morphisms with zero backaction
3. **Molecular Image Encoding** - Physical realization of images as molecular charge distributions

## Structure

The unified paper has three parts:

### Part I: Imaging from Categorical Partitions
- **Section: Entropy Equivalence** - Foundation: oscillation ≡ category ≡ partition
- **Section: Image Derivation** - Images as necessary categorical structures from finite observation
- **Section: Video Derivation** - Videos as temporal sequences with thermodynamic irreversibility
- **Section: Microscopy Derivation** - Microscopy from high-depth partitioning, computational image generation

### Part II: Virtual Imaging and Information Catalysis
- **Section: Virtual Imaging** - Categorical morphisms, dual-membrane pixels, zero-backaction principle
- **Section: Categorical Apertures** - Information catalysts, pixel demon resolution, see-through imaging

### Part III: Molecular Image Encoding
- **Section: Molecular Encoding** - Image-molecule bijection, vibrational phase locking, chemical image processing, spectroscopic readout

## Key Results

**Fundamental bounds on imaging:**
- Resolution limit: δx_min = λ/(2n) from partition geometry (reproduces Abbe limit without wave optics)
- Information capacity: I_max = N_pixel · kB ln N_λ
- Frame rate limit: f_max = 1/τ_lag
- Dynamic range: DR_max = 2^n_A

**Revolutionary capabilities:**
- Virtual instruments can be "placed" anywhere in categorical space (including inside opaque objects)
- See-through imaging without penetrating radiation (exploits partition signature propagation)
- Molecular image storage at ~10^24 bits/cm³ (~10^8× higher than magnetic media)
- Chemical reactions as native image processing operations
- Computational microscopy without microscopes

**Unifying principle:**
> Geometric apertures in categorical space reduce distance for traversal—
> whether spatial (images), molecular (catalysis), or informational (virtual imaging).
