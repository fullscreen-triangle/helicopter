\begin{abstract}
Traditional optical microscopy faces a fundamental limitation: capturing images at different wavelengths, illumination angles, or modalities requires multiple physical measurements, often destroying or altering the sample. We present a virtual imaging framework based on dual-membrane pixel Maxwell demons that generates images at arbitrary wavelengths and modalities from a single capture without re-imaging. The key innovation is a dual-membrane pixel structure where each pixel possesses two conjugate states—a front face encoding amplitude information and a back face encoding phase information—analogous to voltmeter-ammeter complementarity in electrical circuits. 

Pixel Maxwell demons, categorical observers at each spatial location, query molecular ensembles via zero-backaction observations to extract wavelength-dependent responses, angular scattering patterns, fluorescence spectra, and phase information. From a single 550~nm bright-field capture, we demonstrate generation of virtual images at 650~nm (red) and 450~nm (blue) wavelengths, dark-field illumination at 45°, fluorescence with 561~nm excitation, and phase contrast—five distinct imaging modalities from one measurement, achieving 80\% reduction in physical captures.

Validation on biological microscopy images shows high fidelity (SSIM $>$ 0.92) for virtual images, with optical flow consistency within 2.5~pixels/frame. The framework maintains thermodynamic consistency through hardware-constrained validation via phase-locked reference streams. This approach eliminates sample commitment in microscopy, enabling non-destructive multi-modal analysis critical for irreplaceable biological specimens, live-cell imaging, and high-throughput screening.

\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated a virtual imaging framework based on dual-membrane pixel Maxwell demons that generates images at multiple wavelengths and modalities from single captures. The approach achieves 80\% reduction in physical measurements while maintaining high visual fidelity (SSIM $>$ 0.92), solving the sample commitment problem in optical microscopy.

Key achievements include: (1) virtual wavelength shifting (550~nm → 650~nm, 450~nm) without spectral filters or re-imaging, (2) virtual modality changes (bright-field → dark-field, fluorescence, phase contrast) without optical reconfiguration, (3) dual-membrane access to amplitude and phase information simultaneously, and (4) thermodynamic validation ensuring physical consistency.

The framework enables non-destructive multi-modal analysis of irreplaceable samples, reduces photobleaching and phototoxicity in live-cell imaging, accelerates high-throughput screening, and provides retrospective analysis—querying archived images for modalities not captured during acquisition. This establishes categorical computation as a viable approach to expanding imaging capabilities beyond hardware limitations.
