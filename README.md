Helicopter is a revolutionary framework that inverts the Pakati paradigm: instead of generating images from text prompts, it extracts structured knowledge from images and converts them into trainable tokens for domain-specific Language Models. By treating images as a "visual language," Helicopter enables the creation of LLMs that understand domains through expert-level visual interpretation.

## 🌟 Core Concept: "Iterative Expert Research System"

Helicopter operates on the revolutionary principle of **iterative scientific learning**: instead of static analysis, it builds domain expertise from scientific literature, then continuously improves through metacognitive orchestration. This mirrors how researchers actually work—building knowledge, analyzing data, learning from results, and iterating until confident.

### The Research-Oriented Approach:

```
Traditional Approach: Images → Generic Analysis → Static Results
Helicopter Research System: 
    Literature → Domain Expert LLM → Guided Analysis → Learning → Re-analysis → Convergence
```

### Why This Revolutionizes Research:

1. **Literature-Based Expertise**: Builds domain LLMs from scientific publications
2. **Metacognitive Orchestration**: Uses expert LLM to guide analysis decisions
3. **Iterative Learning**: System gets smarter with each image processed
4. **Confidence-Based Convergence**: Continues iterating until research-grade confidence
5. **Continuous Knowledge Growth**: Expert system improves with every dataset
6. **Research-Grade Quality**: Produces analysis that matches domain expert standards

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

### 1. **Iterative Expert Research Pipeline**

**Stage 1: Literature Ingestion & Expert LLM Construction**
- Ingest scientific publications, papers, and domain protocols
- Extract visual analysis knowledge and expected patterns
- Fine-tune domain-specific expert LLM on scientific literature
- Build semantic knowledge base with FAISS indexing for fast retrieval

**Stage 2: Metacognitive Analysis Planning**
- Expert LLM guides analysis strategy for each image
- Query knowledge base for relevant scientific context
- Plan focus areas based on domain expertise
- Set confidence targets and quality thresholds

**Stage 3: Guided Visual Analysis**
- Analyze images using expert LLM reasoning
- Extract features guided by scientific knowledge
- Generate expert-level findings and assessments
- Calculate confidence scores based on literature alignment

**Stage 4: Iterative Learning & Convergence**
- Learn from high-confidence analyses to update knowledge base
- Re-analyze problematic images with improved expertise
- Continue iterations until research-grade confidence achieved
- Generate final analysis with evidence-based reasoning

### 2. **Metacognitive Orchestration Layer**

Building on Pakati's orchestration principles:

- **Context Manager**: Tracks visual token sequences and high-level goals
- **Planner**: Decides between reconstruction, description, or editing modes
- **Checker**: Validates alignment between outputs and original images
- **Reasoner**: Optimizes parameters and resolves visual-textual conflicts

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Differential Analysis**: Extract meaningful deviations from domain expectations
- **Pakati Integration**: Generate ideal reference images for comparison baseline
- **Expert-Aligned Processing**: Mirror how specialists identify abnormalities
- **Context-Driven Tokenization**: Focus on clinically/practically relevant differences
- **Efficient Knowledge Extraction**: Process deviations, not entire image content
- **Regional Deviation Mapping**: Pinpoint location and severity of variations
- **Domain-Specific Training**: Create LLMs that think like expert practitioners
- **Interactive Expectation Setting**: User-guided baseline generation
- **Multi-Scale Differential Analysis**: From pixel-level to semantic-level deviations

## 💻 Quick Start

### Reverse Helicopter: Differential Analysis

```python
from helicopter import ReverseHelicopter, PakatiIntegration

# Initialize the reverse helicopter pipeline
reverse_helicopter = ReverseHelicopter(
    pakati_model="your-pakati-model",
    diffusion_model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1",
    domain="medical_imaging"
)

# Define domain expectation
expectation = "normal chest X-ray, adult male, no abnormalities"
actual_image = "examples/patient_xray.jpg"

# Extract differential knowledge
differential_tokens = reverse_helicopter.extract_deviations(
    actual_image=actual_image,
    expected_description=expectation,
    focus_regions=["lung_fields", "heart", "bones"]
)

print(f"Found {len(differential_tokens)} meaningful deviations")
# Output: Found 3 meaningful deviations

# Get expert-level insights
insights = reverse_helicopter.generate_expert_analysis(differential_tokens)
print(insights)
# Output: "Potential consolidation in right lower lobe, cardiac silhouette within normal limits..."
```

### Expectation-Based Regional Analysis

```python
from helicopter import ExpectationAnalyzer

# Define expected regional characteristics
regional_expectations = {
    "lung_fields": "clear, well-aerated lung parenchyma",
    "heart": "normal cardiac silhouette, cardiothoracic ratio < 0.5",
    "mediastinum": "midline, normal width",
    "bones": "intact ribs and spine, no fractures"
}

# Analyze deviations in each region
analyzer = ExpectationAnalyzer(reverse_helicopter)
regional_deviations = analyzer.analyze_regional_differences(
    actual_image="patient_scan.jpg",
    regional_expectations=regional_expectations
)

for region, deviations in regional_deviations.items():
    if deviations:
        print(f"Region '{region}': {deviations['severity']} - {deviations['description']}")
    else:
        print(f"Region '{region}': Normal (matches expectation)")
```

### Domain-Specific LLM Training

```python
from helicopter import DomainTrainer

# Prepare visual dataset
visual_dataset = helicopter.create_visual_dataset(
    image_dir="data/medical_images/",
    annotations="data/annotations.json"
)

# Train domain-specific LLM
trainer = DomainTrainer(
    base_model="gpt2",
    domain="medical_imaging"
)

trained_model = trainer.train(
    visual_tokens=visual_dataset,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=32
)

# Save the trained model
trained_model.save("models/medical_imaging_llm")
```

### Interactive Visual Chat

```python
from helicopter import VisualChatbot

# Load trained domain model
chatbot = VisualChatbot("models/medical_imaging_llm")

# Chat about images
response = chatbot.analyze_image(
    image_path="patient_scan.jpg",
    query="What abnormalities do you see in this scan?"
)

print(response)
# Output: "I can see a potential mass in the upper right quadrant..."
```
