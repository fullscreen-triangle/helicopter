class AutonomousReconstructionNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, patch_size=32, context_size=96):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Context encoder - understands surrounding patches
        self.context_encoder = nn.Sequential(

## üîÑ Reconstruction Process

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialization**
   - Start with ~20% of image patches as "known"
   - Randomly distribute known patches across image
   - Initialize reconstruction with known patches

2. **Strategy Selection**
   - Choose reconstruction approach based on current state
   - Strategies: edge-guided, content-aware, uncertainty-guided, progressive

3. **Context Extraction**
   - Extract surrounding context for unknown patch
   - Create context window around target patch
   - Mask out target patch area (set to unknown)

4. **Prediction**
   - Use neural network to predict missing patch
   - Generate confidence score for prediction
   - Convert prediction to pixel values

5. **Quality Assessment**
   - Measure reconstruction fidelity against original
   - Update overall reconstruction quality
   - Calculate learning feedback

6. **Learning**
   - Update networks based on prediction success
   - Adapt reconstruction strategy if needed
   - Continue until target quality or convergence

### Reconstruction Strategies

#### Edge-Guided Reconstruction
```python
def _autonomous_patch_selection_edge_guided(self, state):
    """Prefer patches adjacent to known patches"""
    edge_patches = []
    for unknown_patch in state.unknown_patches:
        if self._is_adjacent_to_known(unknown_patch, state.known_patches):
            edge_patches.append(unknown_patch)
    
    return random.choice(edge_patches) if edge_patches else random.choice(state.unknown_patches)
```

#### Content-Aware Reconstruction
```python
def _select_high_detail_patch(self, state):
    """Select patch in high-detail area based on surrounding context"""
    detail_scores = []
    
    for patch in state.unknown_patches:
        detail_score = 0.0
        for known_patch in state.known_patches:
            if self._is_nearby(patch, known_patch):
                # Calculate edge density in known patch
                gray = cv2.cvtColor(known_patch.pixels, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
                edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150)
                edge_density = np.sum(edges) / (edges.shape[0] * edges.shape[1])
                detail_score += edge_density
        
        detail_scores.append(detail_score)
    
    # Select patch with highest detail score
    max_idx = np.argmax(detail_scores)
    return state.unknown_patches[max_idx]
```

#### Uncertainty-Guided Reconstruction
```python
def _select_uncertain_patch(self, state):
    """Select patch where prediction would be most uncertain"""
    context_scores = []
    
    for patch in state.unknown_patches:
        context_score = 0
        for known_patch in state.known_patches:
            distance = self._calculate_distance(patch, known_patch)
            if distance < self.context_size:
                context_score += 1
        
        context_scores.append(context_score)
    
    # Select patch with least context (most uncertain)
    min_idx = np.argmin(context_scores)
    return state.unknown_patches[min_idx]
```

## üìä Quality Assessment

### Reconstruction Quality Metrics

```python
def _assess_reconstruction_quality(self, state, original_image):
    """Assess quality of current reconstruction against original"""
    
    reconstruction = state.current_reconstruction.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    original = original_image.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    
    # Only compare known regions
    mask = np.zeros(original.shape[:2], dtype=bool)
    for patch in state.known_patches:
        mask[patch.y:patch.y+patch.height, patch.x:patch.x+patch.width] = True
    
    if np.sum(mask) == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate MSE in known regions
    mse = np.mean((reconstruction[mask] - original[mask])**2)
    
    # Convert to quality score (higher is better)
    quality = 1.0 / (1.0 + mse * 10)
    
    return quality
```

### Understanding Level Classification

| Quality Range | Understanding Level | Interpretation |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 95-100% | **Excellent** | Perfect pixel-level understanding |
| 80-94% | **Good** | Strong structural understanding |
| 60-79% | **Moderate** | Basic pattern recognition |
| 0-59% | **Limited** | Minimal understanding demonstrated |

class CustomReconstructionEngine(AutonomousReconstructionEngine):
    def _autonomous_patch_selection(self, state):
        """Custom patch selection strategy"""
        
        # Your custom logic here
        if state.iteration < 5:
            return self._edge_guided_selection(state)
        elif state.reconstruction_quality < 0.5:
            return self._content_aware_selection(state)
        else:
            return self._uncertainty_guided_selection(state)

# Use custom engine

        self.confidence_history = []
    
    def _update_reconstruction(self, state, target_patch, predicted_patch, confidence):
        """Override to add monitoring"""
        super()._update_reconstruction(state, target_patch, predicted_patch, confidence)
        
        # Real-time monitoring
        current_quality = self._assess_reconstruction_quality(state, self.original_image)
        self.quality_history.append(current_quality)
        self.confidence_history.append(float(confidence.item()))
        
        # Print progress
        print(f"Iteration {state.iteration}: Quality={current_quality:.3f}, "
              f"Confidence={confidence.item():.3f}")

# Use monitored engine
monitored_engine = MonitoredReconstructionEngine()
results = monitored_engine.autonomous_analyze(image)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(monitored_engine.quality_history, label='Quality')
plt.plot(monitored_engine.confidence_history, label='Confidence')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Batch Processing

```python
def batch_reconstruction_analysis(image_paths, output_dir):
    """Analyze multiple images with autonomous reconstruction"""
    
    engine = AutonomousReconstructionEngine()
    results = []
    
    for i, image_path in enumerate(image_paths):
        print(f"Processing image {i+1}/{len(image_paths)}: {image_path}")
        
        # Load image
        image = cv2.imread(image_path)
        
        # Analyze
        result = engine.autonomous_analyze(
            image=image,
            max_iterations=30,
            target_quality=0.85
        )
        
        # Save results
        result['image_path'] = image_path
        results.append(result)
        
        # Save reconstruction
        reconstruction = result['reconstruction_image']
        output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f"reconstruction_{i}.jpg")
        cv2.imwrite(output_path, reconstruction)
    
    return results

# Process batch
image_paths = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]

    engine = AutonomousReconstructionEngine(
        patch_size=16,  # Smaller patches for medical detail
        context_size=64
    )
    
    results = engine.autonomous_analyze(
        image=scan_image,
        target_quality=0.95  # High quality for medical applications
    )
    
    quality = results['autonomous_reconstruction']['final_quality']
    
    if quality > 0.95:
        return "VALIDATED: System demonstrates complete understanding of anatomical structures"
    elif quality > 0.8:

    else:
        return "FAILED: System does not demonstrate sufficient understanding for medical use"
```

```python
def manufacturing_defect_detection(product_image, reference_image):
    """Detect defects by comparing reconstruction quality"""
    
    engine = AutonomousReconstructionEngine()
    
    # Analyze reference (should reconstruct well)
    ref_results = engine.autonomous_analyze(reference_image)
    ref_quality = ref_results['autonomous_reconstruction']['final_quality']
    
    # Analyze product
    prod_results = engine.autonomous_analyze(product_image)
    prod_quality = prod_results['autonomous_reconstruction']['final_quality']
    
    quality_diff = ref_quality - prod_quality
    
    if quality_diff > 0.1:
        return f"DEFECT DETECTED: Quality drop of {quality_diff:.1%} suggests manufacturing issues"
    else:

### Common Issues

#### Low Reconstruction Quality
- **Cause**: Complex image patterns, insufficient iterations
- **Solution**: Increase `max_iterations`, decrease `patch_size`, adjust `target_quality`

#### Slow Performance
- **Cause**: Large images, small patches, CPU processing
- **Solution**: Use GPU, increase `patch_size`, reduce `max_iterations`

#### Memory Issues
- **Cause**: Large context windows, GPU memory limits
- **Solution**: Reduce `context_size`, use CPU, process smaller images
