Subject: Application for PhD Position - Computational Biology and Super-Resolution Microscopy

Dear Dr. Hell,

I am writing to submit my application for a PhD position in your research group at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences. 

I have developed computational frameworks in biological quantum processes and biomimetic computing that may complement your group's work in super-resolution microscopy. My background includes experience in computational biology, molecular dynamics simulations, and scientific software development, with particular focus on membrane dynamics and biological system modeling.

Please find attached:
- Cover letter detailing my research background and relevant experience
- Curriculum vitae with academic and professional history
- [Additional documents if required - transcripts, references, etc.]

I understand the application deadline may have passed, but I would be grateful if you would consider my application for any available positions or future opportunities in your research group.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience and can provide additional documentation if needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
