\caption{\textbf{Oxygen Gas Model \& Geometric Configuration: Validation Panel---Master Clock, Frequency Partitioning, and Conjugate Therapy.} \textbf{Top left:} O$_2$ rotational energy spectrum showing $E_J = B \cdot J(J+1)$ with rotational constant $B = 1.4457$~cm$^{-1}$ ($\equiv 10^{11}$~Hz). The quantized rotational ladder provides the frequency reference for the master clock. \textbf{Top right:} O$_2$ master clock frequency partitioning showing how harmonics ($\omega_n = n\Omega$ where $\Omega = \omega_{\text{O}_2}$) partition into linked (green) and unlinked (gray) processes. The frequency axis normalized to $\omega_{\text{O}_2}$ shows which cellular processes phase-lock to the oxygen clock. \textbf{Bottom left:} Cytoplasmic geometry showing O$_2$ molecule distribution (red dots), enzymes (green), and localized action volumes (gray spheres indicating conjugate action regions). The 3D scatter reveals spatial organization of O$_2$-mediated catalysis. \textbf{Bottom right:} Conjugate therapy frequency ladder mechanism. Four levels: O$_2$ Master Clock ($\nu = 1.0$, blue), Conjugate Intermediate (purple), Enzyme (diseased) (red, $\varepsilon = 0.30$), and Enzyme (+ conjugate) (green, $\varepsilon = 0.55$). The conjugate increases frequency matching from 30\% to 55\% efficiency, acting as ``frequency gear ratio'' or ``impedance matching''. Arrow indicates therapeutic frequency shift.}

\caption{\textbf{Proton-Electron Charge Balance Coupling: Genome Capacitor + Geometric Aperture Transporters.} \textbf{Top left:} Genome capacitor discharge-recharge cycle showing electron cascade (green, $I_{\text{electron}}$ discharge) and proton transport (blue, $I_{\text{proton}}$ recharge) with time constant $\tau_{RC} = 1.00$~\textmu s. The genome charge $Q_{\text{genome}}$ (red) oscillates as electrons discharge and protons recharge, maintaining charge balance. Key phases labeled: discharge, balance, recharge. \textbf{Top right:} Charge balance versus coupling strength showing electron current $I_{\text{electron}}$ (green), proton current $I_{\text{proton}}$ (blue, coupling-dependent), and balance region (green shaded). Optimal coupling at $g = 0.91$ achieves $I_{\text{balance}} = 2.68$~pA where electron cascade perfectly matches proton flux. Coupling mechanisms listed: electron cascade (fixed), proton transporters (sensitive), ATP-dependent pumps, geometric selectivity. \textbf{Bottom left:} Geometric aperture selectivity (NOT Maxwell Demon)---purely geometric selection. 3D surface shows selectivity versus aperture radius and particle radius. H$^+$ (small, selected), Na$^+$ (intermediate), and H$_2$O (large, excluded) demonstrate size-based filtering without information or energy cost. This geometric mechanism achieves ion selectivity passively. \textbf{Bottom right:} Ensemble transporter coupling dynamics showing electron cascade $I_{\text{electron}}$ (O$_2$-modulated, green), proton flux $I_{\text{proton}}$ (ensemble, $N = 5000$, blue), and balance error (purple, dashed). The charge balance requirement couples electron and proton dynamics, with balance error decreasing over time as the system equilibrates.}
